    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In previous lessons, we reviewed all of the essential components of the Tableau environment to help you quickly begin creating visualizations in Tableau. We have learned how to connect to resources to create a data source. Then, we learned how to create relationships between our connected data and generate worksheets. Finally, we built out some simple visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have gotten a taste of some of the features Tableau has to offer, it is time to put that knowledge to work and test out additional features. In this lab, we are going to use our knowledge of Tableau's interface and its functionality to create a workbook that can help us to build out a cohesive dashboard and tell a story with our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Create a customized bar chart in Tableau\n",
    "* Create a customized scatter plot in Tableau\n",
    "* Create a customized time series plot in Tableau"

In previous lessons, we created a simple bar chart and demonstrated how to use Tableau's functionality to customize it. Now, it's your turn to create a bar chart.\n",
